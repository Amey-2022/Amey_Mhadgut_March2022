Web Development

Suppose i want to develop my own website, for ex: a2zxyz.com
-> First, we will go an register the above domain, for ex: godaddy.com
-> Next, we need a server to host the content for my website
   -> This server has to run 24*7
   -> This server should have a static ip
   Approx cost will be 4 lac for the machine + 25k(domain+ip) + software licenses (1 lac)

   Since the above model is very costly, what we generally do is go for web hosting
   for ex: a hosting provider's plan could be:
   			100 GB bandwidth p.m
   			25 GB storage space
   			1 Database
   			1 Email Account
   			Total Cost: 2000 Rs Annually

   	Another modern flavour of hosting any service on the net is by using Cloud infrastructure
   	(AWS, GCP, Azure, ...)

A website is collection of various types of documents (html, images, style sheets, ...)

A website is made up of client side as well as server side code
-> Client side code is made of up HTML , CSS and JS
-> Server side code is made up of technologies like Servlet/JSP/ASP/PHP, ....

HTTP is the protocol commonly used for client/server communication
- Web Servers and Browsers fully support HTTP protocol

Web Server
-> Basically a software that will be installed on a Server where we will be hosting our websites
  -> Apache Web Server 
  -> Microsoft IIS
  -> Nginx
  -> ...

These Web Servers don't support Java technology by default, so that means we cannot design websites using Java

To enable support for Java technology on servers, we need another software to be installed along with the Web Server, generally called as Web Container or Servlet/JSP Engine:
-> Apache Tomcat
-> JBoss, WebLogic, Websphere, Glassfish, ...

These Web containers have all the features present in a Web Server, but additionally they support Java technology

So it's possible that we don't use a separate web server in our setup.
for ex: we can install Tomcat and use it like a web server

But in live applications, a server + container combination is used commonly
ex:
-> apache web server + apache tomcat
-> microsoft iis + apache tomcat
-> nginx + apache tomcat

TODO:
1. role of web/http server
2. difference between web server and web container
3. what is the role of servlet/jsp
5. what are the steps for writing and running a servlet

Assignment:
1. 
	Version 1:
	Write a form to take two numbers as an input from the user
    Then write a servlet which will add the two numbers and display the sum of it
    Version 2:
	Write a form to take two numbers as an input from the user along with add and sub button
    Then write a servlet which will add or sub the two numbers and display the result of it

2. Write a form to take the date of birth of the user
   then write a servlet to display the age based on the date of birth supplied
   for ex:
   If the user enters: 10-Mar-1995
   Then the output should be:
   Version 1: Your age is 27 yrs
   Version 2: You are 27 yrs 3 months 12 Days old
