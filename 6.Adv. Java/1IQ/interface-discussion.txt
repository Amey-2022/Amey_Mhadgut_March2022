- Object should have a well defined interface
- one class should not communicate will another class directly,
  rather we should use an interface in between

Suppose i tell you to design a Calculator which will perform addition and substraction of numbers

interface Calculator {
 int add(int x, int y);
 int sub(int x, int y);
}

class MyCalculator implements Calculator {
	
	...
}

Suppose i tell you to design a phonebook which will allow users to add, edit, remove, sort, search contacts

interface PhoneBook {
  void add(String name, String number);
  void remove(String name);
  void sort(String order);
  void search(String name);
}

//Developing PhoneBook using Android
class MyPhoneBook extends Activity implements PhoneBook {

}
