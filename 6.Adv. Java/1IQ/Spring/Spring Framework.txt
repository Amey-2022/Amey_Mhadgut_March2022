Spring Framework
- Creating objects of our classes
- Managing dependencies between our objects (DI -> Dependency Injection)

Creating objects of our classes using Spring
- There are couple of ways by which this can be achieved

Option 1
-> We can configure the class whose object has to be created in an xml file
   for ex:
   class HelloWorld {
   	...
   }
   then in the xml,
   <bean id="hw" class="...HelloWorld" />

Option 2
-> We can use annotations instead
   for ex:
   @Component("hw")
   class HelloWorld {
   	...
   }
   But still we need to do one entry in the xml file to make this work:
   <context:component-scan base-package="com.cdac" />

Managing dependencies between our objects (DI -> Dependency Injection)
- DI helps us in achieving loose coupling in our appplications
- Also interfaces play an important role in achieving loose coupling
